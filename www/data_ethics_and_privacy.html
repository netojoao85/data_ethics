With data often tied to human information, there is a growing awareness of the ethical implications associated with its processing. Consequently, 
strict adherence to a global ethical code, coupled with compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is 
imperative to protect the rights and freedom of each person. The non-compliance of these ethical principles and regulations carries legal 
consequences and reputational damage for both individuals and organizations.

Specifically, the 4th, 5th, and 9th articles of GDPR hold significant importance for the daily work of a data scientist, guiding decisions on 
personal data collection and storage. The 4th Article defines personal data and processing, the 5th Article outlines seven principles regulating 
personal data processing, and the 9th Article declares situations where the processing of personal data is prohibited. Additionally, the 6th Article 
specifies conditions for lawful processing of personal data. Below, these GDPR articles are detailed.
