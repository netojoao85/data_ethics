Accountability in Data Science projects spans across development, deployment, and ongoing management phases. This 
responsibility is shared among Data Scientists, organizations, regulators, and policymakers. Data scientists ensure ethical practices, organizations 
cultivate responsible cultures, and regulators establish legal frameworks. Overall, the collective efforts aim to align ethical standards and fair 
decision-making expectations.
