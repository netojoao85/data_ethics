# Data ethics and Privacy

<p align="justify"> The increase in the amount of data has come with new challenges for Data Scientists, such as ethics. Although a data scientist's opinion does not matter and should not have any relevance, his behaviour does. For that reason, adhering to a global ethical code and law such as the <b>General Data Protection Regulation</b> (GDPR) is essential to protect the citizens' rights and freedom in their data process. </p>
  

<p align="justify"> In particular, the 4th, 5th, and 9th articles of GDPR assume relevant importance for the regular work of a data scientist, supporting personal data collection and storage decisions. The 4th Article defines personal data and processing, the 5th Article establishes a set of principles to regulate personal data processing, and the 9th Article declares prohibited processing of some personal data. Beyond those three articles, the 6th Article enumerates the different situations of Lawfulness of processing. As such, according to the GDPR, these topics will be described for a better understanding and to support Data Scientists' decisions. </p>
