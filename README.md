# Data ethics and Privacy
 
The increase in the amount of data has come with new challenges, once behind the data there are people who have their rights that should be protected, and for this reason, clarifying the meaning of personal data has extremely important. According to that, **General Data Protection Regulation** (GDPR), Article 4, we find the definition for what is personal data, the 5th Article establishes a set of principles to regulate personal data processing, and the 9th Article declares prohibited processing some personal data. A better understanding of these subjects have importance in supporting our decisions about the collection and storage of the data, and for that, next these topics will be explored more:

<ul>
 <li> <b>personal data</b> is “any information relating to the data subject, which allows for his direct or indirect identification, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person” (source: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/4). </li>
 
 <li> <b> processing personal data shall be </b>: (a) Transparent, lawful, and fair; (b) Limited to its purpose; (c) Minimal, adequate and necessary to the purpose defined (data minimisation); (d) The data should be kept accurate and up-to-date, and not kept longer than needed; and (e) The Integrity and Confidentiality of the data have to be warranted (source: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/5/2016-04-27). </li>

 <li> <b> prohibited processing personal data </b> that “revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data to uniquely identify a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation”.
