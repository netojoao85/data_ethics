# Data ethics & Privacy (GDPR)

<p align="justify"> The exponential increase in data volume has come with new challenges for Data Scientists and organizations, namely in legal and ethical implications. </p>
Behind data, there are in many cases humans, increasing the awareness regarding the ethical implications of data processing. Consequently, strict adherence to a global ethical code and compliance with laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are imperative to protect the rights and freedom of each person. Failure to comply with ethical principles and regulations may lead to legal action and damage to the reputations of both individuals and organizations. </p>
  

<p align="justify"> In particular, the 4th, 5th, and 9th articles of GDPR assume relevant importance for the regular work of a data scientist, supporting personal data collection and storage decisions. The 4th Article is one of the most important of GDPR once it defines what is personal data and processing. The 5th Article outlines the seven principles that regulate the processing of personal data, and the 9th Article declares specific situations where the processing of personal data is prohibited. Beyond those three articles, the 6th Article specifies the conditions that processing personal data is considered lawful. Bellow, these GDPR articles are detailed. </p>

# Data Bias & Fairness
<p align="justify"> Bias is also a big issue in Data Science and can influence decision-making. Data is biased when the sample (data available) is not representative of the population or phenomenon of study. </p>

<p align="justify"> Bias is difficult to deal with because cannot just remove all the variables that we think might cause bias because they may hold predictive power and we could end up with no variables left. </p>

<p align="justify"> The other problem is that there may be other variables that could be ‘proxies’ for sensitive characteristics. For example, if the ethnicity or religion were removed from a model build but kept the name in then it could end up being a proxy as names can often reflect different ethnicities.  </p>
