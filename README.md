# Data ethics and Privacy (GDPR)

<p align="justify"> The exponential increase in data volume has come with new challenges for Data Scientists and organizations, namely in ethical implications. <br><br>
Behind data, there are in many cases humans, increasing the awareness regarding the ethical implications of data processing. Consequently, strict adherence to a global ethical code and compliance with laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are imperative to protect the rights and freedom of each person. Failure to comply with ethical principles and regulations may lead to legal action and damage to the reputations of both individuals and organizations. </p>
  

<p align="justify"> In particular, the 4th, 5th, and 9th articles of GDPR assume relevant importance for the regular work of a data scientist, supporting personal data collection and storage decisions. The 4th Article is one of the most important of GDPR once it defines personal data and processing. The 5th Article establishes a set of principles to regulate personal data processing and known as the seven GDPR principles, and the 9th Article declares prohibited processing of some personal data. Beyond those three articles, the 6th Article enumerates the different situations of Lawfulness of processing. As such, according to the GDPR, these topics will be described for a better understanding and to support Data Scientists' decisions. </p>
